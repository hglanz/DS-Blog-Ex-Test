      <description>What are Projects?RStudio Projects are a mechanism for keeping all the files associated with a project together in one place â€“ data, R scripts, results, figures, reports, etc. Projects are built in to the RStudio IDE, and for good reproducible workflow, all projects should start by creating a Project.
Why RStudio?It goes almost without saying that as a group we have moved completely to the RStudio interface to R.</description>
