      <description>The NASEM Data Science for Undergraduates report noted that the storage, preparation, and accessing of data is at the heart of data science and that students need to directly experience multiple forms of data, including the use of databases.
SQL (pronounced sequel) stands for Structured Query Language; it is a language designed to manage data in a relational database system. The papers https://chance.amstat.org/2015/04/setting-the-stage and https://chance.amstat.org/2015/04/databases/ provide a high level overview of database systems.</description>

      <description>What is the Tidyverse?The tidyverse is a coherent system of R packages for data wrangling, exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy. These packages are intended to make statisticians and data scientists more productive by guiding them through workflows that facilitate communication, and result in reproducible work products. Unpacking the tidyverse, all that it means and contains, could easily take a dedicated book or blog in itself.</description>
